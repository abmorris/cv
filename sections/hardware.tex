\topictitle{Ion feedback monitoring}{
Periodic analysis of the level of ion feedback in the HPDs installed in the RICH to predict when they need to be replaced.
}{2015 --- 2016}
\topictitle{RICH upgrade testbeam}{
Participant in 4 testbeam periods, during which I took data-taking shifts and improved the automation of the data acquisition and processing. I also performed the dark count analysis and developed an online alignment tool.
}{2014 --- 2016}
\topictitle{Performance of MaPMTs in magnetic fields}{
Per-pixel efficiency measurements as a function of magnetic field strength. This work was the basis of the decision to use $\mu$-metal shielding in the RICH upgrade.
}{2013 --- 2014}
