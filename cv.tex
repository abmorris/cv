	\section{Personal statement}
	I am a PhD student with the LHCb group at the University of Edinburgh.
	My research experience is in studies of four-body charmless hadronic decays of $B$ mesons.

	\section{Physics analysis}
	\topictitle{Amplitude analysis of $B^0_s \to \phi K^{+}K^{-}$ decays}{}{2015 ---}
	An amplitude fit to ${B^0_s \to \phi K^{+}K^{-}}$ events with ${m(K^{+}K^{-})<1.8}$~GeV. The decay ${B^0_s \to \phi f_2^\prime(1525)}$ is observed for the first time, and measurements are made of its branching fraction and longitudinal polarisation fraction.
	\\[0.5em]
	This is my primary thesis work, and I was responsible for performing the analysis, from selection, modelling the acceptance, signal and background, fitting the data and calculating results and systematic uncertainties.
	The amplitude fit was performed using Edinburgh's RapidFit fitting framework, which I modified to make more suited to the task.
	The PDF was adapted from the $B^0 \to \psi(2S) K^{+} \pi^{-}$ analysis, and extended to become extensively runtime-configurable, allowing many versions of the fit to run simultaneously on a HPC cluster without the need to re-compile.
	\\[0.5em]
	\topictitle{Measurement of the $B^0_s \to \phi\phi$ branching fraction and search for $B^0 \to \phi \phi$~\textnormal{\cite{phiphiBF}}}{}{2014 --- 2015}
	The $B^0_s \to \phi\phi$ branching fraction was measured using $B^0 \to \phi K^{*0}$ for normalisation, resulting in a factor of five reduction in the statistical uncertainty compared to the previous best result.
%	This is an important normalisation channel for charmless $B$ decay measurements, such as $B_s \to \phi \pi^{+} \pi^{-}$.
	In addition, a search was performed for the suppressed $B^0 \to \phi\phi$ decay, and an upper limit placed on its branching fraction, which is a factor of seven improvement comapared to the previous best result.
	\\[0.5em]
	This analysis forms part of my thesis work, and I was responsible for the mass fits and most of the calculations of efficiencies and systematics, as well as setting the limit on the $B^0$ mode using the $CL_s$ method.
	\\[0.5em]
	\topictitle{Measurement of CP violation in $B^0_s \to \phi\phi$ decays~\textnormal{\cite{phiphiCPV}}}{}{2013 --- 2014}
	A time-dependent angular fit performed to $B^0_s \to \phi\phi$ events to extract the weak phase $\phi_s$, which is expected to be close to zero due to cancellation between the leading-order mixing and decay diagrams.
	\\[0.5em]
	I was responsible for parametrising the peaking backgrounds and performing fits to the $\phi\phi$ invariant mass to obtain event yields.
